  Parameters:
    assets - See docs/input_tables.md
    asset_types - See docs/input_tables.md
    asset_actions - See docs/input_tables.md
    start_year - The first year the model calculates actions for. This should be an
      integer value. This should be <= end_year.
    end_year - That last year the model calculates actions for. This should be an
      integer value. This should >= start_year.
    necessary_actions - See docs/functions.md
    cost_adjustment - See docs/functions.md
    annual_adjustments - See docs/functions.md

  Returns:
    performed_actions - see output_tables.md
  This run includes no constraints on the spending per year
